# Windows UI Application
This is a Windows UI interface application created using HTML, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript.  No JQuery or any Java Script Packages used. 

This is a single page web application. The look and feel is like a windows application but it is build on HTML, CSS3 and Javascript so it runs on a browser. 

The UI was create with the help of code from [www.techumber.com](http://www.techumber.com). You can read the post [here](https://www.techumber.com/the-ultimate-windows7-desktop-using-pure-css3-jquery/)

The app communicates to the database using REST. The REST is a single page php file that can be pluged into any database.

The REST API is created from the core of [php-crud-api](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api/blob/master/extras/core.php)

You are free to download and use/modify the code the way you want.

Thank you,
